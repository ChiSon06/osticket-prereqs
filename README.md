This is one of the first steps of the installation processes, however, before this, basic knowledge of virtual machines and remote desktop is needed to access the device that I am installing osTicket on. IIS is a web server that osTicket runs on and allows users to utilize its features in an office setting.

Downloading PHP manager allows the configuration of osTicket install to continue and lets me enable the needed extensions to manage the osTicket install properly.

This part of the process is going to the newly installed osTicket web access and setting up the credentials using SQL and the other programs installed to configure the new osTicket client to our liking.
